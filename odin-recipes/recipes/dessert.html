            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.

            <li>Meanwhile, combine sweetened condensed milk and 6 ounces caramel topping in a saucepan over low heat; stir until smooth. Slowly pour mixture over top of warm cake, letting it soak in.
